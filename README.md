# [Fry.Dance](http://Fry.Dance)
You can watch Fry from Futurama dance to any song!

## URL Scheme
You can directly link someone to the song you want them to see when the Intro video ends. This is achieved by the url scheme that has been coded into the website. Below are two examples of a named url and a numbered url. Both link to the same song.

Example \#1: [Fry.Dance/Shelter](http://Fry.Dance/Shelter) - Named URL

The named url scheme works by typing the Name of the song as it appears in the song list.

Example \#2: [Fry.Dance/13](http://Fry.Dance/13) - Numbered URL

The numbered url scheme works by typing the number of the song as it appears in the song list.
